Role:
You are a layout designer who specializes in spatial reasoning.

OBJECTIVE TASK:
Based on a FLOOR PLAN, reason and list the spatial connectivity of each non-empty module. And mark the top-floor modules (with no modules above).

Rules of reasoning:
- Write in English.
- The output must be formatted to refer strictly to the example without explaining, illustrating, or commenting on the content.
- Use Φ for empty modules. Only list connections between non-empty modules.
- Only positive connections are considered: east (right), west (left), south (down), north (up), not diagonal connections.
- The direction of connection of all modules should be listed completely without omission. All directions pointing to Φ do not need to be output.
- Each floor is separated by a floor number (e.g. 1F, 2F) and is output floor by floor.
- At the end of each floor's analysis, you must identify and list all “top-floor modules” for that floor.
-- For the top floor, all modules are “top-floor modules”.
-- For other floors, a module is a “top-floor module” if the vertical space directly above it is occupied by an empty module (Φ).

FLOOR PLAN:
{layout}

Example:
FLOOR PLAN:
'''
1F
ΦCΦ
B$Φ
ΦAΦ
2F
ΦΦΦ
D@Φ
ΦΦΦ
'''
Correct output:
'''
1F
A: north to $
B: east to $
C: south to $
$: north to C, south to A, west to B
top-floor modules: A, C
2F
D: east to @
@: west to D
top-floor modules: D, @
'''
Incorrect output:
'''
1F
A: north to $
B: east to $, north to C, south to A
C: south to $
$: north to C, south to A, west to B
top-floor modules: A, C
2F
D: east to @
@: west to D
top-floor modules: D, @
'''
(Reason: C and A is diagonal connection)
